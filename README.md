# CSE556-safe-swift
### Instruction
Since we are using Firebase, so we need to install some dependency first
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Open Terminal
cd to our project
then issue this command
```
pod install
```
I'm already have all the dependency in there, so just run this command will make us install all the dependency
Then we want to click the safe.xcworkspace file to work on the project
